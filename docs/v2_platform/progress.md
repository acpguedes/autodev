# v2 Platform — Implementation Progress

> Living tracker for the v2.0 platform refactor described in
> `docs/architecture/v2_platform_reference.md`. Update this file whenever a story or
> epic changes state, whenever a wave gate is cleared, and whenever an ADR/RFC is
> added (cross-check `docs/v2_platform/decisions/README.md`). This file is the single
> place to look to answer "where are we on the v2 rewrite?" without re-reading the
> 6600-line reference document.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-04 (E2-S3 complete)

## How to update this file

1. When a story (`E<n>-S<m>`) moves through the workflow states in §18.1 of the
   reference doc (Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> Validation -> Done),
   update the "Stories complete" count and "Status" for its epic in the table below.
2. When an epic's last story reaches Done, flip its "Status" to `Done` and record the
   date in the Changelog.
3. When a wave's exit criteria (§18.9, reproduced below) are fully satisfied, flip the
   wave's status and record the date.
4. Keep this file and each `phases/E<n>_*.md` "Status" header in sync — the phase doc
   is the detail, this file is the summary.
5. Do not mark anything "Done" without the evidence the global DoD
   (`templates/dod_checklist.md`) requires (green contract tests, docs updated,
   observability verified, etc.).

## Current wave: Alpha (in progress)

E0 is complete with all seven foundation stories done. The repository also
contains several **informal precursors** to Alpha-wave capabilities
(auto-discovered plugin seams, an agent/skill registry, dynamic orchestration
behind a flag, a SQLite store abstraction with migrations) — see
`docs/feature_matrix.md` for their exact status and each `phases/E<n>_*.md`
file's "v1 precursor / starting point" section for how they map onto the v2
epics. None of them satisfy the v2 contracts (manifests, `hostApi` versioning,
permissions, contract tests) as written, so they are starting points, not
completed epic work.

The v1 codebase is now frozen at the `v1.0.0` git tag (see `CHANGELOG.md`) as the
baseline these epics build on and are measured against. E0 now provides the
local-first and production-like foundation for the remaining Alpha work. **Next
action: pick up E1 after reading `phases/e1_plugin_core_sdk.md` and
`agent_guide.md` §1-2.**

## Wave exit gates (§18.9 of the reference doc)

### v2.0-alpha — "usable extensible core"

Goal: prove the small core + pluggable edges end to end in local-first mode.
Anchor epics: **E0** (complete), **E1**, **E2**, **E3** (graph/checkpointing/
human-in-the-loop stories; visual editor can stay minimal), **E8-S1/E8-S2**,
**E9-S1** (minimal API), **E12-S1** and the start of **E12-S2**.

- [ ] A declarative flow executes an agent-plugin end to end with durable state and
      event-store replay.
- [ ] Contract tests green for the E1/E2/E3 extension points.
- [ ] Local-first mode (SQLite + stub provider) runs with no external dependencies.
- [ ] Core coverage >= 85%.
- [ ] Basic per-step traces emitted.

### v2.0-beta — "full platform in controlled production"

Goal: complete intelligence, context, data, API, UI, security, and quality
capabilities for real, controlled operation. Anchor epics: **E4**, **E5**, **E6**,
**E7**, **E8-S3/E8-S4**, **E9-S2/S3/S4**, **E10**, **E11**, **E12-S2/S3/S4**.

- [ ] The real plan -> code -> apply patch -> validate in sandbox -> evaluate flow runs
      with RBAC, fail-closed budgets, and end-to-end traces.
- [ ] Hybrid retrieval reaches p95 < 300 ms and the recall baseline.
- [ ] Run streaming starts < 1 s.
- [ ] Every extension point has a green contract test and quality gates block merges.
- [ ] UI is WCAG 2.2 AA on key screens; flow editor round-trips.
- [ ] Backup/restore validated (RPO <= 5 min, RTO <= 30 min) in staging.

### v2.0-GA — "general availability"

Goal: open the Marketplace and declare general availability with SLO, security, and
upgrade-support guarantees. Anchor epic: **E13** complete, plus final hardening, the
v1 upgrade migration, and release notes.

- [ ] Verified plugin publish/install (signature + SBOM) end to end.
- [ ] Control Plane SLO 99.9% and read p95 < 300 ms under load
      (>= 100 concurrent runs per reference node).
- [ ] RPO <= 5 min / RTO <= 30 min proven in production.
- [ ] GA checklist signed off (SLOs, security, docs, backups, evals).
- [ ] v1 -> v2 upgrade path documented and tested.
- [ ] GA release published with notes.
- [ ] `docs/v2_platform/documentation_rebuild.md` executed for the GA milestone.

## Changelog

Add a dated entry every time a story/epic/wave status changes.

- **2026-07-02** — Created `docs/v2_platform/` (this tracker, per-epic phase docs,
  process/manifest templates, agent guide, decisions log, documentation-rebuild
  playbook). No implementation work started. Baseline captured from
  `docs/architecture/v2_platform_reference.md` and `docs/feature_matrix.md`.
- **2026-07-02** — Packaged and tagged the v1 architecture as `v1.0.0` (see
  `CHANGELOG.md`) immediately before starting Alpha-wave work: validated `make check`
  end-to-end, fixed two mypy failures uncovered by that pass, refreshed
  `docs/feature_matrix.md` (several rows had gone stale — typed settings module,
  `GET /features`, env-driven CORS, CI coverage/smoke gates, the Tailwind/shadcn
  foundation — plus a new Security section and reclassifying tree-sitter extraction
  as a `stub`), and synced the status banner in
  `docs/architecture/weaknesses_and_strategies.md`. No epic/story status changes from
  this pass — it is a baseline/documentation checkpoint, not epic work.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S0: added the containerized backend dev/test runtime,
  Compose wiring for container CLI/test execution, and README/v2 guidance making the
  backend container the baseline E0 execution environment.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S1: added Makefile container targets for backend
  build/up/shell/test/check/down/logs and documented the container-first workflow in
  `docs/testing.md`.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S2: added typed declarative settings with
  local/prod profiles, JSON file plus environment precedence, fail-fast
  `autodev config validate`, redacted settings inspection, and `docs/config.md`.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S3: implemented PostgreSQL-backed sessions/runs/
  messages/plans, selected it from `DATABASE_URL`, added local Compose Postgres
  support, recorded ADR-001, and published the backup/restore runbook.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S4: added configured OpenTelemetry request and
  run-step spans, non-PII trace correlation attributes, Prometheus 5xx counters,
  and `docs/ops/observability.md`.
- **2026-07-03** — Completed E0-S5: added default HTTP security headers, an
  opt-in HSTS setting, dependency-free `run_secret_scanning`, a backend CI
  secret/SCA gate, and `docs/security/baseline.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E0-S6 and closed E0 after auditing existing
  settings/job queue work: kept local mode dependency-free, implemented Redis
  queue/cache/locks with lock contention coverage, added local and MinIO/S3
  artifact stores with recoverable patch/log objects, wired Redis/MinIO into the
  production-like Compose profile, and published `docs/ops/storage.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E1-S1: added the typed plugin extension-point catalog,
  `plugin.yaml` dataclasses and validator, the published JSON schema, RFC-001,
  ADR-002, and `docs/plugins/manifest.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E1-S2: added Plugin Host discovery from directories
  and entry points, durable install/enable/disable/uninstall lifecycle state,
  `hostApi` compatibility rejection with reasons, isolated load failures, and
  documented `plugin.installed`/`plugin.enabled`/`plugin.disabled` events.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E1-S3: added the default-deny fs/net/exec/secrets
  permission model, brokered Host API access, in-process import sandbox checks,
  `plugin.permission.denied` audit events, denial-by-permission tests, and
  `docs/plugins/permissions.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E1-S4: added SemVer-versioned Python SDK contracts,
  a minimal TypeScript contract stub, `sdk new plugin` scaffolding through the SDK
  and main CLIs, the plugin contract-test harness, a runnable example plugin, and
  `docs/sdk/write-your-first-plugin.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E1-S5 and closed E1: added the active-plugin registry,
  `/v2/plugins/active` query API with `schemaVersion`, registry consistency after
  enable/disable, safe dev hot-reload rollback, and `docs/plugins/registry.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E2-S1: added the versioned `agent.yaml` manifest
  validator, strict typed IO validation with safe default budgets, the initial
  capability vocabulary in ADR-003, the published SDK contract surface, schema file,
  and `docs/agents/manifest.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E2-S2: added the durable Agent Registry, SemVer
  resolution with multiple versions, rankable capability search, deprecation
  signaling, Plugin Host sync for enabled agent manifests, `/v2/agents/catalog`, and
  `docs/agents/registry.md`.
- **2026-07-04** — Completed E2-S3: added the Agent Runtime execution cycle with
  fail-closed token/cost/step/tool-call budgets, strict input/output validation,
  output denylist guardrails, per-step trace emission, token/cost metrics, and
  budget-overrun and guardrail tests.
