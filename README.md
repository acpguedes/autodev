# Project: **AutoDev Architect**

*(LLM-based framework for software architecture, code generation, and automated project evolution)*

---

## üìå Overview

**AutoDev Architect** is an LLM-based development framework that empowers engineers, software architects, and product teams to both **create new projects** and **evolve existing ones**.

Through a **chat interface**, users can:

1. Describe requirements or goals.
2. Receive a **task plan** automatically generated by the system.
3. Approve or modify the plan.
4. Execute the plan to generate or update architecture, code, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation.

Unlike traditional code generators, AutoDev Architect also provides **introspective navigation** of existing codebases, enabling the LLM to **search, analyze, and apply changes incrementally** while preserving project integrity.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure (Agents)

The system is composed of **specialized agents**:

1. **Planner Agent**

   * Converts requirements into structured task lists.
   * Handles decomposition of high-level goals into actionable steps.

2. **Navigator Agent**

   * Indexes the project repository (AST parsing + vector embeddings).
   * Supports semantic code search (‚ÄúWhere is the login logic?‚Äù).
   * Locates relevant files, functions, and classes for modification.

3. **Analyzer Agent**

   * Compares the user‚Äôs request with the current state of the project.
   * Proposes changes as **Git-style patches** instead of full rewrites.
   * Ensures modifications are minimal and localized.

4. **Architect Agent**

   * For new projects: defines architecture in JSON/YAML DSL.
   * Produces diagrams (C4, UML, text-based architecture maps).
   * Chooses frameworks, libraries, and design patterns.

5. **Coder Agent**

   * Generates or updates code according to plans or diffs.
   * Writes unit tests, documentation, and helper scripts.
   * Produces patches that can be reviewed and merged.

6. **DevOps Agent**

   * Generates CI/CD configurations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps).
   * Produces Dockerfiles, Helm charts, Terraform for cloud deployment.

7. **Validator Agent**

   * Runs tests, linting, security scans, and static analysis.
   * Validates both new projects and modifications.
   * Provides actionable feedback loops to other agents.

8. **Chat Interface**

   * Single interaction layer for the user.
   * Enables approval/rejection of plans, inspection of diffs, and exploration of the repo.

            Feedback Loop
```

* **Core LLM Layer**: Pluggable (GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini, Grok).
* **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: JSON/YAML DSL for architecture + Git patches for code updates.
* **Execution Sandbox**: Safe container to run generated code/tests.
* **Feedback Loop**: Validator results drive automatic refinement.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Stack

* **Frontend (Chat UI)**: React or Next.js with REST/GraphQL.
* **Backend Orchestration**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js; LangChain/LangGraph for agent workflows; Redis/Kafka for task queuing.
* **LLM Engines (pluggable)**: GPT (OpenAI/Azure), Claude (Anthropic), LLaMA (Meta), Gemini (Google), Grok (xAI).
* **Repo Indexing & Search**: Tree-sitter for AST parsing, FAISS/Weaviate/Milvus for semantic search.
* **Infra & DevOps**: Docker + Kubernetes; Git-based versioning (each run produces commits/patches); Terraform + Helm for deployment.
* **Validation**: Pytest/Jest, SonarQube, Bandit, security scans, coverage reports.

## üîÑ Typical Workflows

**1. New Project Creation**

* User: *‚ÄúBuild a user registration microservice with REST API and Postgres.‚Äù*
* Planner ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Coder ‚Üí DevOps ‚Üí Validator.
* Output: full repo with architecture, code, CI/CD, and documentation.

**2. Project Evolution**

* User: *‚ÄúAdd JWT authentication to the login API.‚Äù*
* Navigator locates relevant files.
* Analyzer proposes diffs.
* Coder generates patches.
* Validator runs tests.
* User reviews patches ‚Üí approves ‚Üí commit pushed.

## üìä Success Metrics

* **Delivery speed**: time from requirement ‚Üí working code/patch.
* **Acceptance rate**: % of plans and diffs approved without rework.
* **Code quality**: test coverage, lint compliance, regression rate.
* **Refactor efficiency**: ratio of minimal vs full-file rewrites.
* **User satisfaction**: NPS, qualitative developer feedback.

---

## üöÄ Key Differentiators

* **Creation + Evolution**: supports both greenfield projects and continuous improvement of existing codebases.
* **Multi-model support**: GPT, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini, Grok.
* **Patch-based changes**: safer, auditable updates via Git diffs.
* **Introspective navigation**: semantic search + AST indexing for precise edits.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: approvals at plan and patch stages.
* **Reproducibility**: all changes committed with traceability.
